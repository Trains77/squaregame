# Square "Game"
It is a really bad and dumb square game I made, it is currently a game where you move a yellow square around in a black void
Move with the arrow keys

It requires python 3.6 running on a Linux system to run

Requires the following packages: colored, pygame, and pydub

It does also need a valid X server to work, it might work on wayland tho, I'm not to sure
