# Square Game
This is my first python program I have ever made, and it is pretty bad

The game is basically you move a yellow square torwards a greenish square while avoiding the red squares

You move with the arrow keys

It requires python 3.6 running on a ~~Linux system to run~~ it will run on Windows and Linux, but Windows lacks audio

Requires the following packages: colored, pygame, and pydub, and pypresence to enable discord presence

It does also need a Display server to work on Linux, it might work on wayland, I haven't tested
