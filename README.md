# Square Game
This is my first python program I have ever made, and it is pretty bad

The game is basically you move a yellow square torwards a greenish square while avoiding the red squares

You move with the arrow keys

It requires Python3 and should work anywhere python can run, It has however, only been tested to work with Python 3.6 with Linux

Requires the following packages: colored, pygame, and pydub

It does also need a Display server to work on Linux, it might work on wayland, I haven't tested
